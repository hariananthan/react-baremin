# react-baremin
The bare minimum code required to setup react quick and easy. :zap: 

Takes less space than create-react-app and contains only the essential dependencies and configuration so that you can build your app as you like from there.

# SETUP  
Open the terminal/command prompt in the desired directory and clone the repository using the command
>git clone <git_URL>

Navigate to the root directory(one in which **package.json** file is in) using
>cd react-baremin

Install dependencies using
> npm install

Wait for all the dependencies to get installed. :clock1: 

Once done run the command
>npm run dev

Open **localhost:9000** to see your app running!  :fire:



PS, hit the :star: if you like it.

# react-baremin
The bare minimum code required to setup react quick and easy :zap:. 

Takes less space than create-react-app and contains only the essential dependencies and configuration so that you can build your app as you like from there.

# SETUP  
Open the root directory(one in which **package.json** file is in) and run the command
> npm install

Wait for all the dependencies to get installed :clock1:. 

Once done run the command
>npm run dev

Open **localhost:9000** to see your app running.  :fire:
